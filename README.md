# Content
This is a repository of my templates for contributing code.

It will include specific contributing guides for my projects for each language and general contributing styles.

# Why we should have guidelines to code?
There are some reasons, for example:

- Consistent look. This will cause that the reader can concentrate on the actual behavior of the code and not the design.
